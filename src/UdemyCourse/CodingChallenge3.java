        Exercise 1
        Write a program with two int variables, int x and int y, and give each one a value.
        Depending on their values, print “x is bigger than y”, “x is smaller than y”, or “x and y are the same”.
        Change the values and run the program a few times to check it works.

        Exercise 2
        Modify the program from Exercise 1 so it also prints the difference between x and y.

        Exercise 3
        Create a game where the program picks a random number from 1 to 5 and you, the player, has to guess it.
        If the player guesses right, print “Correct! Aren’t you lucky.“.
        If the player guesses wrong, print “Hard luck! Maybe next time.“.
        You can use the line of code below which produces a random number from 1 to 5 and stores it in a variable called
        randomNumber.
        int randomNumber = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(1, 6);

        Exercise 4
        Modify the program from Exercise 3 so it gives the player two chances to guess the number.
