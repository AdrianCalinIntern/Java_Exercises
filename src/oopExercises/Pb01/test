Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities. Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
You will want to create a separate class for Contacts (name and phone number). Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts.
The MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above. Add a menu of options that are available.
Options:
    • Quit,
    • Print list of contacts,
    • Add new contact,
    • Update existing contact,
    • Remove contact and search/find contact.
When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists (use name).
Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the Arraylist to MobilePhone (e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc.)
MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.



Design an implement abstract/concrete classes and/or interfaces (and the relationships between them) for the following domain:
        a. There are 3 types of vehicles:  car, boat and airplane
        b. Each type of vehicle has the following properties: name, weight, speed
        c. Airplanes have an extra wingspan property.
        d. Each type of vehicle can do the following actions, but in a different way:  start engine, cruise, turn, stop engine (write out different strings in each method)
Construct an array 10 vehicles (of a variety of types in arbitrary order) and perform some actions on all of them.
